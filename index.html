    <h3>Anime & video games</h3>
    <p>I started watching anime when I think I was like 10 years old but I really got into it when I got into the fifth grade.
    I enjoy characters from different shows and what they can do, along with some of their stories and fights.As for video games
    I'm pretty sure I have been playing video games since I was in the 4th or fifth grade but I like some of the games I play mostly 
    they're the boss or just looking cool in games.</p>

    <h3>working out</h3>
    <p>I would have to say one of my good skills are putting in the time and hardwork for stuff like working out.
    I'm still a new to it but i have a better understanding of it now. I like working hard and pushing my limits to improve myself 
    and get better at what I'm doing.Then you get to see the results and I like looking back on how I changed and evolved, with what I went through.
